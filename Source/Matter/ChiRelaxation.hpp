//!  Calculates RHS for relaxation of the conformal factor, for initial
//!  conditions
/*!
     The class calculates the RHS evolution for the relaxation of the conformal
     factor chi, in order to satisfy the Hamiltonian constraint for some general
     matter configuration. It assumes that the other variables (K, h_ij etc) are
     fixed and satisfy the Momentum constraint. It calculates the RHS at each
   step as the relaxation speed multiplied by the error in the Hamiltonian
   constraint. It is extremely inefficient and takes a long time to converge,
   but it works provided that there is indeed a sensible solution (note that it
   can converge to \chi = 0 everywhere if there is not, so one must always check
   it is converging on something sensible). Note that the relaxation speed
   should be set to a value less than 2/15*dx_min/courant_factor for numerical
   stability. \sa m_relax_speed()
